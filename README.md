Welcome to the Python Programming Core-Overview Learning Journey repository! üêç‚ú®

## Acknowledgment
I explored various resources to successfully navigate my learning journey of Python. I visited multiple websites, referred to notes from Durga Software Solutions, sought guidance from my college professor, and these combined efforts significantly contributed to a smoother and faster learning experience. I express my gratitude to all those who have been instrumental in supporting my learning process.

## Overview
This comprehensive guide is designed for beginners to advance their skills in Python programming. Explore the following units to master key concepts, from Python basics to machine learning. I have gathered a variety of documented notes from different sources to enhance the quality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this learning journey, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of the following:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with any programming language (not necessarily Python)
- Text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for coding (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)
- Python installed on your machine (latest version recommended)
