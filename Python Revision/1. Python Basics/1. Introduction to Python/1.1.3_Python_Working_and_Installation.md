## How Python Works
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. This means that Python code is not compiled into machine code before it is run, but instead, it is interpreted by a Python interpreter. The interpreter reads the Python code and executes it line by line. This makes Python a very flexible and portable language, as it can be run on any platform that has a Python interpreter.

Python is also a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not need to be declared with a type before they are used. The type of a variable is determined at runtime, based on the value that is assigned to it. This makes Python a very expressive language, as it allows you to write concise and readable code.

Here is an **overview of how Python works:**

1. **Source code:** You write Python code in a plain text file, using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

2. **Tokenizer:** The tokenizer breaks down the Python code into a sequence of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation.

3. **Parser:** The parser analyzes the tokens and builds a syntax tree, which represents the structure of the Python code.

4. **Compiler:** The compiler converts the syntax tree into Python bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the Python code.

5. **Interpreter:** The interpreter executes the Python bytecode line by line. The interpreter also maintains the runtime environment, which includes the current values of all variables and objects.

6. **Output:** The interpreter prints the output of the Python program to the console or to a file.
