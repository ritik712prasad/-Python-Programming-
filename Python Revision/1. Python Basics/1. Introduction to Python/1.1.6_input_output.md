# Printing Output 

##### In Python, the `print()` function is commonly used for output. 
#### Syntax

```python
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

- `value1, value2, ...`: These are the values you want to print. You can print multiple values, and they will be separated by the `sep` parameter.

- `sep=' '`: This is the separator between the values. By default, it's a space character.

- `end='\n'`: This is the character that is printed at the end. By default, it's a newline character (`\n`), which means the next `print()` statement will start on a new line. You can change it to any string if you want to alter the end character.

- `file=sys.stdout`: This is the file where the output will be printed. By default, it's the standard output, which is usually the console. You can redirect it to a different file if needed.

- `flush=False`: If `True`, the output is forcibly flushed, meaning it's written to the console immediately. By default, it's `False`.

Here are some examples:

```python
# Basic print statement
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

# Using sep to change the separator
print("One", "Two", "Three", sep="-")

# Using end to change the end character
print("This is on the same line", end=" ")
print("as the previous line.")
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
Name: Alice Age: 30
One-Two-Three
This is on the same line as the previous line.
```

Feel free to customize the `print()` function based on your specific needs. If you're using Python 3.6 or newer, you can also use f-strings for more advanced formatting:

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 25
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")
```

# Reading Input from keyboard
```python
input()
input(prompt)
```


##### The input() method reads a line from input,  converts into a string and returns it.
#### Syntax
```
variable = input("Prompt to the user: ")
```
**input():** This function reads a line from the user, converts it to a string, and returns that string.

**Prompt to the user:** This is an optional string argument that serves as a prompt to the user, indicating what kind of input is expected. It is displayed on the console.

**variable:** This is the variable that will store the user's input. Keep in mind that the input is always returned as a string, so if you need it as a different data type (e.g., integer or float), you'll need to perform a conversion.


>Example
```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_input + "!")

```   


### Taking multiple inputs using `split()`:

```python
a, b = input("Enter two values separated by a space: ").split()
```

Explanation:
- **`input("Enter two values separated by a space: ")`**: This part prompts the user to enter two values separated by a space.
  
- **`.split()`**: The `split()` method is applied to the input. It splits the entered string into a list of substrings based on the default delimiter, which is a space.

- **`a, b`**: The variables `a` and `b` are used to unpack the values obtained from the split operation. If the user enters, for example, "3 5", `a` will be assigned the value "3", and `b` will be assigned the value "5".

### Displaying output using `{}` and `.format()`:

```python
txt = "first number is {}, second number is {}".format(1, 2)
print(txt)
```

Explanation:
- **`"first number is {}, second number is {}".format(1, 2)`**: This is a string with placeholders `{}` for values to be inserted using the `.format()` method.

- **`.format(1, 2)`**: The `.format()` method is called on the string. It replaces the `{}` placeholders with the values provided as arguments. In this case, the first `{}` is replaced by the value "1", and the second `{}` is replaced by the value "2".

- **`print(txt)`**: This prints the formatted string stored in the variable `txt`.
