## Identifiers

**A name** in Python program is called **identifier**.
It **can be class name** or **function name** or **module name** or **variable name**.

> In Python, the terms "variables" and "identifiers" are related but not exactly the same.
> An identifier is a name given to entities in a Python program, such as variables, functions, classes, etc.
> A variable is a specific type of identifier that is used to store and represent data in a program.

###### Example-
```python
x = 5
# Here, 'x' is an identifier used to name a variable.
```

#### Rules to define identifiers in Python:

###### 1. The only allowed characters in Python are:
    -  ↪️ alphabet symbols(either lower case or upper case)
    -  ↪️ digits(0 to 9)
    -  ↪️ underscore symbol(_)
###### 2. Identifier should not starts with digit
###### 3. Identifiers are case sensitive. Of course Python language is case sensitive language
###### 4. We cannot use reserved words as identifiers
###### 5. If Identifier is start with Underscore (_) then it indicates it is private (recommended) and  If identifier starts with __(two under score symbols) indicating that strongly private identifier. Also If the identifier starts and ends with two underscore symbols then the identifier is language defined special name,which is also known as magic methods.
###### 6. There is no length limit for Python identifiers. But not recommended to use too lengthy identifiers.

##### Example-
 - 🟤 cash = 10     ✔️  alphabet is allowed    
 - 🟤 ca$h = 20     ✖️  Dollor ($) Symbol is not allowed in Python
 - 🟤 123total      ✖️  can't starts with digit
 - 🟤 total123      ✔️  valid form
 - 🟤 total = 10    ✔️  alphabet is allowed
 - 🟤 TOTAL = 999   ✔️  different identifer from 'total'
 - 🟤 def = 10      ✖️  def is reserved word in python
 - 🟤 if = 20       ✖️  if is reserved word in python

> it is recommanded that we can use these Conventions for making of identifers like **Snake Case** (e.g., my_variable, calculate_total), **Camel Case** (e.g. calculateTotal, myFunction), **Pascal Case** (e.g., MyClass, PersonDetails).

## Reserved Words

**In Python some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality. Such type 
of words are called Reserved words.**

> There are 35 reserved words available in Python.
- True,False,None
- and,or,not,is
- if,elif,else
- while,for,break,continue,return,in,yield
- try,except,finally,raise,assert
- import,from,as,class,def,pass,global,nonlocal,lambda,del,with
- async await
```python
and       as        assert    async     await
break     class     continue  def       del
elif      else      except    False     finally
for       from      global    if        import
in        is        lambda    None      nonlocal
not       or        pass      raise     return
True      try       while     with      yield

```
> - All reserved words in Python consist only of alphabet symbols. For example, if we write 'claSS' or 'Class', they are not considered keywords.
> - However, there are three exceptions to this rule. The reserved words ```'True False None``` contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase alphabet symbols.For example, if we write ```true``` ,then it is **not a keywords.**




## Constants 

Constants concept is not applicable in Python.

While Python does not have a built-in constant keyword, it is a convention to use uppercase letters for variables that are not intended to be changed. (if we don’t want to change value.)
```
MAX_VALUE=10
```
**It is just convention but we can change the value.**
**NOTE**
> If you want to create true constants that cannot be changed, you can use the 'constants' module:
example-
 ```
 from constants import PI, GRAVITY, MAX_SPEED

 ```
