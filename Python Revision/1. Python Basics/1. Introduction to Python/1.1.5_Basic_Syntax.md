### Indentation:

The Python syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create a Python Program.
Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define the scope of code blocks. Consistent indentation is crucial for proper code execution.
A code block (body of a function, loop etc.)  starts with indentation and ends with the first  un-indented line.
Python indentation is very important, if we don;t indendent python code properlly then paytho code can give error while runng running.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    #correct way of to write python code
```
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:# incorrect Way of writing 
print(fruit)  # Incorrect indentation

```


### Comments:

Python supports two types of comments:

**Single Line Comment:**
```python
# This is single line comment.
```
**Multi Line Comment:**
Multi lined comment can be given inside triple  quotes.
Use ''' comments ''' or """ comment """

```python
'''
This is a
multi-line comment
'''
```
```
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

> In Python, the use of semicolons (;) as statement terminators, which is common in some other programming languages, is not required. 

**The following are various important escape characters in Python**
1) \n==>New Line
2) \t===>Horizontal tab
3) \r ==>Carriage Return
4) \b===>Back space
5) \f===>Form Feed
